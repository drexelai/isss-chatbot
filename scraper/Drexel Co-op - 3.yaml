conversations:
- - I am an international student and will have an F1 visa. Can I do co-op?
  - Yes, you are eligible to participate in the co-op program if you have an F1 visa.
- - Will participating in the co-op program affect my Optional Practical Training (OPT)?
  - If you are enrolled in the One Co-op (Four Years) option, it will not affect your OPT. If you are enrolled in the Three Co-op (Five Years) option, it will affect your OPT if you do all of your co-ops full-time in the United States. In order to preserve their OPT for after graduation, students with three co-ops will often do one of their co-ops part-time or one of them abroad. For more information regarding your OPT, please contact our International Students and Scholars Services (ISSS) office at<a href="mailto-isss@drexel.edu">isss@drexel.edu</a>or by phone at 215.895.2502.
