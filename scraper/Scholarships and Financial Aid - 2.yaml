- - How do I apply for scholarships?
  - International students are automatically considered for merit aid during the application review process. No additional paperwork is required. Merit scholarship decisions are based on the credentials submitted at the time of application. Students who are awarded a merit scholarship will be notified in their acceptance letter. If you are interested in need-based aid, you must complete the<a href="http-//cssprofile.collegeboard.org/">CSS Profile</a>by the appropriate deadline. To view the deadlines and find more information regarding the CSS Profile, please visit the<a href="/undergrad/financing/apply/">How to Apply for Aid</a>page.
- - I cannot cover the entire cost of a Drexel education. Can I have a job on campus?
  - International students on an F1 visa may work on campus. However, we cannot guarantee that you will be able to find a job. Unfortunately, we are unable to provide a job assignment to you and it will be your responsibility to seek out and apply for on-campus jobs if you wish to have one.
